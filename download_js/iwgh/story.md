## Captain Picard's ready room.

- I have nothing to do with this dead Klingon, obviously, but it is interesting that his body was found in my quarters. I doubt anyone was so naive as to think that this would make me a suspect. It seems more reasonable to assume that he was actually killed there. Perhaps it is more important to find out why this Klingon was in my quarters in the first place and what he was looking for, - says captain Picard. - But first of all we should try to identify him. Deliver the body to sickbay for it to be put in morgue. Dr. Crusher will start to work on his identification immediately.

As you are about to leave:

- And ensign - well done. Your discovery has shed some light on the whole investigation.
